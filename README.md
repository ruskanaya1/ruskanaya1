- 👋 Hi, I’m @ruskanaya1
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science... just don't know what exactly it is I want to devote my time in because there is sooo much cool and amazing things that would take a few life times to get a good idea of how it all works!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end web development technologies including getting comfortable with a plethora of softwares, text editors, IDEs cloud based functions CLI and so on...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will get my feet wet for now.
